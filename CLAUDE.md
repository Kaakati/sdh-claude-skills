# Software Development House — Enterprise Development Standards

This repository follows enterprise-grade development standards for a professional software development house. All contributors and AI agents must adhere to these guidelines.

> **This repository is packaged as the `sdh` Claude Code plugin.** Components live at the
> plugin root: `skills/` (46 workflow skills + 26 `std-*` convention skills + `sdh-engineering-standards`), `agents/` (14),
> `hooks/` (with `hooks/hooks.json`), and the manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. The
> former `.claude/rules/*.md` are now `std-*` skills (`paths:`-scoped to the files they govern).
> See `README.md` for install. A plugin's `CLAUDE.md` is **not** loaded as context for
> consumers — the baseline standards ship as the `sdh-engineering-standards` skill, which Claude
> loads from its description when relevant.

## Project Identity

We are a Software Development House building production systems for clients. Quality, maintainability, and security are non-negotiable. Every line of code represents our professional standard.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Backend | Ruby on Rails | API-only mode, shared by all frontends |
| Backend (Python) | FastAPI or Django + DRF | AI/ML serving, data pipelines, client-mandated stacks; FastAPI default, Django for admin-heavy CRUD |
| AI/ML | PyTorch, scikit-learn, MLflow | Served via FastAPI; `pgvector` on PostgreSQL for embeddings |
| View Layer | Phlex | Object-oriented Ruby views (~1.4 Gbps rendering) |

| Local Dev | Docker Compose | PostgreSQL, Redis, Centrifugo, Rails |
| Philosophy | Community libraries first | Prefer proven gems/packages over custom code |

### Library Preferences
- **Prefer community libraries over native/custom implementations.** If a well-maintained gem or npm package exists for the job, use it.
- Authentication: `devise` + `devise-jwt` | Authorization: `pundit`
- Pagination: `pagy` | Search: `pg_search` | Geospatial: `rgeo`, `geocoder`
- HTTP: `faraday` (Rails), `axios` (React Native + Web)
- Forms: `react-hook-form` + `zod` (web: shadcn `Field`; Next.js re-checks the same schema with `safeParse` in the server action) | Navigation: `@react-navigation/native` (a root stack, one bottom tab per area, a native stack per tab)
- Storage: `react-native-mmkv` | Images: `react-native-fast-image`
- Views: `phlex-rails` + `class_variants` | Stimulus: `stimulus-rails`
- Web Routing: `react-router` (Vite SPA; import from `react-router`, with `RouterProvider` from `react-router/dom`) | Web Styling: `tailwindcss`; `cn` from `@/lib/utils` (re-exports the `cn` package) in shadcn packages, `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` elsewhere
- Web Animations: `framer-motion` (house page and list transitions) + `tw-animate-css` (shadcn primitives only, under a mandatory global `prefers-reduced-motion` backstop)
- Charts (one library per stack, each chart with a text alternative): the shadcn/ui `chart` component (Recharts) in Next.js | `chart.js` 4.5.1 + `react-chartjs-2` 5.3.1 in the Vite SPA (one registration module, never `chart.js/auto`) | `chart.js` through a house Stimulus controller in Rails Phlex views (not Chartkick). ApexCharts and `react-apexcharts` are not house libraries
- Web Testing: `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` + `msw`
- Next.js Images: `next/image` | Next.js Navigation: `next/link`
- UI gates: `@casl/ability` + `@casl/react`, both on major 7 (Vite SPA, Next.js, React Native; rules come from the Rails `/me` payload; UX only — Pundit decides)
- Web UI (Next.js + Vite SPA): `shadcn/ui` — Base UI primitives for new packages, Radix kept for existing ones (base read from `components.json` `style`; never two bases in one package); toasts per base (shadcn `Toast` on Base UI, `sonner` on Radix) behind a house `notify()` taking translation keys; dark mode via `next-themes` (Next.js) or the house theming provider (Vite SPA); shadcn's token names (`destructive`, `sidebar-*`, `chart-1`…`chart-5`) registered as aliases of house tokens. React Native keeps the house RN approach — shadcn is web-only
- Python Tooling: `uv` (deps/venv) + `ruff` (lint + format) + `mypy` | Validation: `pydantic` v2
- Python HTTP: `httpx` | Jobs: `celery` (Redis broker) | ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic (FastAPI) / Django ORM
- Python Auth: `pyjwt` + `argon2-cffi` | Django API: DRF + `drf-spectacular` + `simplejwt` | Geo: GeoDjango (PostGIS)
- Python AI/ML: `mlflow`, `pandera`, `onnxruntime`, `pgvector`, `anthropic` | Testing: `pytest` + `factory_boy`/`polyfactory`

## Git Workflow

- **Conventional Commits**: All commit messages must follow the format `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `style`, `revert` (the full set `pre-commit-check.py` accepts — anything else is blocked)
  - Example: `feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation`
- **Branch Naming**: `feature/TICKET-123-short-description`, `bugfix/TICKET-456-fix-desc`, `hotfix/TICKET-789-critical`, `release/v1.2.0`
- **PR Requirements**: Description with context, test plan, screenshots for UI changes, at least one approval
- **Merge Strategy**: Squash merge to main, rebase feature branches on target before merge
- **Protected Branches**: No direct pushes to `main`, `master`, or `develop`

## Code Standards

- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **DRY**: Do not repeat yourself — extract shared logic into well-named utilities
- **KISS**: Keep it simple. Prefer clarity over cleverness
- **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, small functions, minimal comments (code should be self-documenting)
- **Functions**: Max 30 lines. If longer, decompose into smaller units
- **Files**: Target max 300 lines. Split when a file has multiple responsibilities

## Architecture

- **Rails Backend**: Service objects for business logic, Panko serializers for JSON, Phlex for views (Atomic Design), charts in views through a house Stimulus controller on Chart.js, Sidekiq for background jobs
- **Python Backend**: Routers (FastAPI) / ViewSets (DRF) → Services → Models, Pydantic schemas at boundaries, Celery for background jobs
- **React Native Frontend**: Zustand stores for client state, TanStack Query for server data, Centrifugo for real-time; a root stack, one bottom tab per area, a native stack per tab
- **ReactJS (Vite SPA)**: Pages → Hooks → API Client, React Router 8 (lazy-loaded; each area a pathless layout route), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, Chart.js via `react-chartjs-2`
- **Next.js (App Router)**: Server Components for data fetching, server actions for mutations, Client Components for interactivity, shadcn/ui components, charts through the shadcn/ui `chart` component (Recharts), one route group per area
- **Drill-down navigation** (every product, new and existing): the global sidebar or tab bar lists areas only (≤ 7 per role on desktop, 3–5 native tabs; a breach triggers a design review), and each area's section nav lives in that area's own layout. Every level has a URL that carries its list state, breadcrumbs come from the API's `ancestors`, and search is the second way in; a command palette is optional and never the only one. Canonical: `skills/ui-ux-patterns/references/drill-down-navigation.md`
- **Drill-down-ready APIs**: one canonical parent per resource; collection routes nest one level and member routes are flat by ID; a detail carries a permission-filtered `ancestors` chain; every level scopes, then finds (404 outside scope); counts are computed inside the caller's scope. Canonical: `skills/std-api-design/references/drill-down-resources.md` (tree storage: `skills/std-database/references/hierarchies.md`)
- **Clean Architecture**: Controllers → Services → Models (Rails) | Screens → Hooks → API Client (React Native) | Pages → Hooks → API Client (Vite) | Server Components → Server Actions → API Client (Next.js)
- **Dependency Injection**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions. Use DI containers where appropriate
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Use bounded contexts, aggregates, and value objects for complex business domains
- **Orthogonality**: one owner per concept, one mechanism per concern per deployable, and dependencies that follow the declared context map. Look a concept up before adding a model, table, or library. A second representation kept on purpose (a read model, a denormalized column, a client-mandated library) carries an ADR and a `.claude/orthogonality.json` declaration. Canonical: `skills/orthogonality/SKILL.md`

## Testing

- **Coverage Targets**: 80% for business logic, 60% overall minimum
- **Test Pyramid**: Unit tests (many) > Integration tests (some) > E2E tests (few)
- **Test Quality**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert). One concept per test
- **Naming**: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- **CI Gate**: Tests must pass before merge. No skipping or disabling tests without a tracking ticket

## Security

- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. Use environment variables and secret managers
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs at system boundaries
- **SQL**: Parameterized queries only. No string concatenation for query building
- **Dependencies**: Audit dependencies regularly. No known critical vulnerabilities in production
- **OWASP**: All code must account for OWASP Top 10 risks

## CI/CD

- All PRs must pass CI pipeline (lint, test, build, security scan) before merge
- No direct pushes to main — all changes go through pull requests
- Automated deployments from main to staging, manual promotion to production
- Feature flags for incremental rollouts of significant changes

## Documentation Standards

- Documentation ships with the code — update docs in the same PR as the code change
- Every public API endpoint must have documented parameters, return types, and error codes
- Use ADR format (ADR-NNN: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences) for architectural decisions — store in `docs/adr/`
- Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` following Keep a Changelog format (Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated, Removed, Security)
- Runbooks for operational procedures go in `docs/runbooks/` with: When to Use, Steps, Verification, Rollback, Contacts

## Hooks (Deterministic Automation)

Active hooks are registered in `hooks/hooks.json`. **Every entry is a command hook**; none is a prompt or agent hook. Each runs `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run-python.sh" <script>`.

- **The launcher.** It finds Python 3 (Windows: `python`, `py -3`, `python3`; macOS/Linux: `python3`, `python`), caches the interpreter in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, and forces UTF-8.
- **Fail-closed gates.** Registered `--fail-closed` (`security-scan`, `dangerous-command-blocker`, `terraform-command-gate`), a missing interpreter or a crash before the gate decides exits 2 and **blocks**. Every other hook exits 1 there: a visible, non-blocking error. A gate that runs past its `timeout` (10 s; 30 s for `security-scan`) is cancelled and the tool runs, as for any timed-out PreToolUse command hook; the permission floor is what still holds then.
- **Output.** Hooks follow the output contract per event in `hooks/README.md`. A deny's reason reaches Claude; an ask's reason is shown only to the user.
- **Background hooks.** `orthogonality-index.py` (SessionStart, `async`) and `orthogonality-watch.py` (PostToolUse and PostToolUseFailure, `asyncRewake`) run in the background: Claude Code starts each one and continues without waiting for it. The watcher stays under its 150 s timeout, which Claude Code enforces for `asyncRewake`. Under `claude -p`, a background hook still running at teardown is killed, and the index resumes from its last commit in the next session. With the dispatched `orthogonality-checker.py`, they never ask, deny, or block, and `SDH_ORTHOGONALITY=off` turns all three off.

**PreToolUse** (before the tool runs). Decisions are `permissionDecision` JSON, and every deny or ask is also written to the audit trail. The five shell gates are registered on `Bash|PowerShell|Monitor` and read `tool_input.command` through the shared shell lexer (`hooks/_shell.py`: POSIX for Bash and Monitor, PowerShell for PowerShell). A quoted mention is not an invocation, while subshells, `$(...)`, `if`/`for` bodies, and the scripts `bash -c`, `pwsh -Command`, `Invoke-Expression`, `cmd /c` or `wsl` run are read as commands.
- `security-scan.py` — **Fail-closed.** Matchers: `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit` and MCP file writers (`^mcp__[^_].*__(write_file|edit_file|create_directory|move_file|create_or_update_file|push_files)$`, the same pattern the script checks, shared as `_hooklib.MCP_FILE_WRITE_MATCHER`; a move's `destination` is judged too, and each `files[]` entry a GitHub `push_files` commits is judged as a write of its own, path and content). Other MCP tools, such as Gmail `create_draft` or Drive `create_file`, never reach it.
  - **Denies** writes to protected files: `.env`/`.envrc`/`.env.*` (templates excepted), key material, and data files in a project's `secrets/`, `credentials/`, or `private/`. The tables live in `hooks/_protected.py`.
  - **Denies** provider-format keys under any variable name: Anthropic, OpenAI, Stripe, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, AWS, Google OAuth, npm, private key blocks.
  - **Asks** on CI workflow edits (with a checklist), credential-shaped literals, and Google `AIza` keys.
- `mcp-install-gate.py` — Fail-open. Matchers: `Bash|PowerShell|Monitor`, `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`, and the same MCP file writers.
  - **Asks** on `claude mcp add`, reporting the real `-s`/`--scope` and `-t`/`--transport`.
  - **Asks** on `shadcn mcp init` through any runner (`npx`, `pnpm dlx`, `bunx`, `yarn dlx`), which writes MCP configuration from inside the CLI.
  - **Asks** on writes to `.mcp.json` or to `.claude.json` servers, including shell redirects, `tee`, copies, PowerShell `Set-Content`/`Out-File`, an MCP move onto `.mcp.json`, and a `push_files` entry; names are compared case-insensitively.
  - **Asks** on a write that approves a project's servers wholesale: `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true`, or a new `enabledMcpjsonServers` name, in `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`. `disabledMcpjsonServers` never asks.
  - An MCP server is an instruction source, so a human picks it.
- `migration-validator.py` — Fail-open; **asks**, never denies. Matcher: `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`. It judges the migration as it will be after the write.
  - Rails `db/migrate` and multi-database `db/<name>_migrate`: `up` without `down`, irreversible forms in `change`, `rename_column`, and destructive operations in the forward direction (a drop inside `def down` or `dir.down` undoes the migration and is not asked about).
  - Alembic `alembic/versions` and Django `migrations/`, parsed with `ast`: destructive forward operations, an empty `downgrade()`, RunPython/RunSQL with no reverse.
  - Interpolated raw SQL.
- `dangerous-command-blocker.py` — **Fail-closed**; denies. Matcher: `Bash|PowerShell|Monitor`. Judges the program that actually runs, including text handed to `bash -c`, `eval`, `ssh host "…"`, `| sh`, `pwsh -Command`, `Invoke-Expression`, `cmd /c`, or `wsl`. Program names match without regard to case or a `.exe` suffix:
  - `rm -rf` by target (root, home, wildcard, system dirs, a bare `$VAR/`; `rm -r` of root or home needs no `-f`), `mkfs`, and `dd` or redirects onto devices and system paths.
  - PowerShell: `Remove-Item -Recurse` (any alias or parameter prefix) on a drive root, the home directory or a system directory, and on a wildcard, `.` or bare-variable target with `-Force` and no filter; `rd /s` and `del /s` through `cmd /c`; `Format-Volume`, `Clear-Disk`, `Remove-Partition`; a download run through `Invoke-Expression`; `Invoke-WebRequest`/`Invoke-RestMethod` uploads to an external URL. `-WhatIf`, filtered deletes and `-OutFile` downloads pass.
  - Destructive SQL through a database client (local test and development databases exempt), and a remote `redis-cli FLUSHALL`.
  - `sudo rm`, world-writable `chmod`, recursive `chown root`.
  - Netcat listeners, and `curl` POST or data upload to external URLs.
  - Shell writes, through `security-scan`'s tables (`hooks/_protected.py`): a provider key written through a redirect or `tee` into any file, and a write to an environment file or key material, are denied unless seeded from a committed template (`cp .env.example .env` passes); a data file in `secrets/`, `credentials/` or `private/` asks.
- `pre-commit-check.py` — Fail-open. Matcher: `Bash|PowerShell|Monitor`.
  - **Denies** a commit whose **subject line** is not a Conventional Commit (from `-m`, a heredoc, a PowerShell here-string, or `-F`; bodies and trailers pass).
  - **Denies** a force push or deletion of a protected branch (`SDH_PROTECTED_BRANCHES`, default `main,master,develop`).
  - **Asks** on a direct push to a protected branch. A push that names no destination (`git push`, `git push origin HEAD`) is resolved in the event cwd's repository (`@{push}`, else the current branch): a direct one to a protected branch asks and a forced one is denied. A force push that names no destination and does not resolve to a protected branch still asks.
- `deployment-gate.py` — Fail-open; **asks**. Matcher: `Bash|PowerShell|Monitor`.
  - Pushes to protected branches (same push parser as `pre-commit-check`, destinations resolved the same way) and any force push.
  - `aws ecs` deploys, `vercel deploy`/`--prod`, image pushes.
  - fastlane release lanes and upload actions, `eas submit`/`update`, `gcloud run|app|functions deploy`.
  - Terraform belongs to `terraform-command-gate`.
- `terraform-command-gate.py` — **Fail-closed.** Matcher: `Bash|PowerShell|Monitor`. Covers terraform and tofu, including through `sudo`, `bash -c`, `docker run hashicorp/terraform`, and `terraform.exe`.
  - **Denies** `destroy`, `apply -destroy`, `apply -auto-approve`, `state rm|mv|push`, and `force-unlock`.
  - **Asks** on `apply`, with a checklist.
  - Allows the read-only surface.

**PostToolUse** (after a successful tool call). Advisory output reaches the model as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, capped at 20 lines / 4,000 characters (`SDH_HOOK_MAX_WARNINGS=0` lifts the cap). Nothing here blocks. The background `orthogonality-watch.py` speaks only by exiting 2, which wakes Claude with its stderr.
- `auto-format.py` — Matchers: `Edit|Write|MultiEdit` and `^mcp__[^_].*__(write_file|edit_file)$`. Runs the project's own formatter:
  - `rubocop --autocorrect --fail-level=error`, through `bundle exec` when `Gemfile.lock` pins it;
  - `prettier --write` from the nearest `node_modules/.bin`;
  - `htmlbeautifier`;
  - `ruff format --quiet` from the nearest `.venv`;
  - `terraform fmt`.

  Safe corrections only. A missing formatter, a timeout, or a failure is announced once per session. Vendored shadcn/ui primitives are skipped.
- `post-edit-dispatch.py` — Same matchers. Runs the 15 **deterministic** advisory checkers below in one process: no agent, no model, no tokens. It first waits (bounded) for auto-format to finish the file, shows at most 5 lines per checker, and skips and names the remaining checkers past a 20 s budget. A crash in any checker becomes a `HOOK ERROR` line, never silence.
  - `test-runner.py` — Reminds you of the related tests (colocated JS/TS, Rails `spec/`/`test/` mirrors, pytest `tests/` mirrors, a Django app's `tests/`), once per session per file.
  - `code-quality-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-code-standards` skill: 30-line functions, 4-param max (a destructured props object is one), 3-level nesting. File limits are 200 lines for Rails models, Django `models.py`, and .tsx components, 300 lines elsewhere. Python is measured with `ast`.
  - `error-handling-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-error-handling` skill: empty `catch`/`rescue`/`except` blocks (including a binding-less `catch {}` and comment-only bodies) and `rescue Exception`. Also the `std-python` skill's width rule: bare `except:` / `except BaseException`.
  - `test-coverage-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-testing` skill: source under Rails `app/`, JS/TS `src/`, or a Python `src/`/`app/` package with no matching test file. Python uses pytest layouts rooted at `pyproject.toml`, `manage.py`, `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`, and a Rails model's Minitest `test/` mirror counts. It shares test-runner's candidates (`hooks/_testpaths.py`) and warns once per file per session.
  - `clean-architecture-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-clean-architecture` skill: layer boundary violations and dependency direction. Flags HTTP concerns in Rails services (`render`, `head`, status codes) and Python services (`HTTPException`, `JSONResponse`, `status.HTTP_*`). App Router Server Components are exempt.
  - `i18n-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-i18n` skill: hardcoded user-facing text in .tsx/.jsx (each JSX text node judged on its own) and .erb files.
  - `accessibility-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-accessibility` skill: clickable `div`/`span`, alt text, label associations, focus indicators, ARIA misuse. Scoped to browser-React `.tsx`/`.jsx`/`.css`/`.scss`; React Native is skipped by marker detection, under any wrapper dir.
  - `api-design-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-api-design` skill: URL nouns, the data wrapper, the `error`/`code`/`status`/`details`/`requestId` envelope, HTTP status codes. Scoped to `app/controllers`, `src/api`, `src/actions`, Next.js route handlers (`app/**/route.ts|js`), and FastAPI `app/routers`/`app/api`, under any wrapper dir.
  - `monitoring-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-monitoring` skill: **sensitive data in log statements only**. It deliberately does **not** check for `request_id`: Rails attaches that id via `config.log_tags`, so the remedy is config, not an edit at the call site (see `std-monitoring/references/request-tracing.md`). Scoped to `.rb` under `app/controllers` and `app/jobs`, and `.py` under `app/routers`, `app/api`, `services`/`tasks`/`views` packages, and Django `views.py`/`viewsets.py`/`services.py`/`tasks.py`.
  - `atomic-design-checker.py` — Enforces the `atomic-design` skill: atom independence, molecule composition, organism boundaries, naming, across Phlex, ReactJS, Next.js, React Native. Every import form is read.
  - `rails-routes-checker.py` — Flags `Sidekiq::Web` mounted in `config/routes.rb` with no authentication. It reads `config/initializers/` first, because the API-only idiom protects the Rack app there. Session and cookie middleware and `app_url` are not authentication.
  - `terraform-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-terraform-conventions` skill: hardcoded secrets, snake_case naming, required tags on AWS resources (sibling `.tf` files and a calling root module's `default_tags` count), backend config, per-provider version pins.
  - `design-token-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-design-system` skill: hex colors, arbitrary spacing and font sizes, color utilities naming no registered token (shadcn's 15 alias names are registered), styled host controls without `focus-visible`, movement without a reduced-motion path.
  - `database-design-checker.py` — Enforces the `std-database` skill's plan-first sequence.
    - **Notice:** once per session, on the first edit to a database file, a plan-first notice: (0) look up whether the concept already exists, through the `orthogonality` skill, then relationships in Rails association terms → query/index plan → constraints → migration plan → verify.
    - **Flags:** `has_and_belongs_to_many` (use `has_many :through` a join model), Rails migration foreign-key columns without an index (a later sibling migration's index counts), and SQLAlchemy `ForeignKey` without `index=True`.
    - **Scope:** `db/migrate`, `db/schema.rb`, `structure.sql`, `app/models`, Django migrations and models, `alembic/versions`, and `*.sql`, any wrapper dir.
  - `orthogonality-checker.py` — Enforces the `orthogonality` skill, and runs last. It reads the project's architecture index read-only and parses only the edited file.
    - **Flags:** a second model or table for an existing concept, and a copied fact (DK1–DK4, MF3, MF5); a second library or mechanism for a concern already covered (CM1–CM4); cross-context dependencies, cycles, and writes (BC1–BC3). A cycle between inferred contexts warns only between sibling folders.
    - **Output:** at most 3 `ORTHOGONALITY [<ID> <slug>]` lines within its own 1.5 s budget, only for findings new since the baseline and not yet shown this session. Each line names both locations, the measured signal, and the owner skill.
    - **Without an index:** it checks the edited file alone (DK4, MF3, MF5, CM1) and says so once per session. Cross-file clones (DK6) and Terraform duplication run only in the skill's scans.
  - **Vendored shadcn/ui primitives** are CLI-owned. `hooks/_vendored.py` resolves the `components.json` `aliases.ui` directory (refusing one that equals `aliases.components` or holds `molecules/`, `organisms/` or `templates/`), and inside it:
    - code-quality, test-coverage, i18n, and atomic-design skip the file;
    - accessibility keeps only the clickable-`div` and hidden-interactive checks;
    - design-token keeps only the unregistered-token check.
- `orthogonality-watch.py` — Background: `asyncRewake: true`, timeout 150 s. Matchers: `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Bash|PowerShell` and `^mcp__[^_].*__(write_file|edit_file)$`; also registered on **PostToolUseFailure** (`Bash|PowerShell`), so an install or generator whose chained command fails still refreshes the index.
  - **What it catches:** writes the edit checkers never see. Package installs (`npm install ky`, `bundle add httparty`, `uv add requests`), generators (`rails g model`, `manage.py startapp`, `alembic revision`), and `git checkout|switch|pull|merge|rebase`, read through the shell lexer and through runner prefixes (`bundle exec`, `uv run`, `poetry run`, `python -m`, `docker compose run|exec`).
  - **What it does:** updates the architecture index for the changed paths (waiting up to 15 s when another refresh holds the index lock), then wakes Claude by exiting 2 with at most 5 stderr lines, only for findings not yet shown this session.
  - **When it stays quiet:** an irrelevant command or file exits before the engine loads. A crash exits 0 and is recorded, and `orthogonality-checker.py` reports it once per session.
  - **Community tools** (packwerk, import-linter, tach, dependency-cruiser, jscpd, squawk) run only with `SDH_ORTHOGONALITY_TOOLS=1`, and only when the project already has them. Nothing is ever installed.
- `audit-logger.py` — Matcher `*`, also registered on **PostToolUseFailure** and **PermissionDenied**.
  - **What it records:** one redacted JSON line per tool call (event, tool, outcome, target; the command for Bash, PowerShell and Monitor) in `<project>/.claude/audit/audit.log`. The gates append their deny/ask decisions to the same file.
  - **Where the log lives:** anchored to the main checkout, and the directory ignores itself with its own `.gitignore`.
  - **When it fails:** fail-open, but a write failure is announced to the user as `systemMessage`.

**SessionStart** (when a session begins or resumes):
- `session-start-check.py` — Command hook; never blocks. It prints one JSON object with two parts:
  - **For the model:** git state and the detected framework area, with that area's scoped convention skills, as `additionalContext`.
  - **For you:** a **GOVERNANCE GAP** as `systemMessage`, when a secrets, privilege, remote-exec, or infrastructure deny rule, or its `PowerShell(...)` mirror, is missing from every settings source it can read (project, local, user, file-based managed). A managed floor that carries the whole catastrophic tier counts as complete, and a missing `Read(**/*secret*)` is then a note to the model.
- `orthogonality-index.py` — Command hook with its own entry (matcher `startup|resume|fork`, `async: true`), so the sentinel above never waits on it.
  - **What it does:** refreshes the project's architecture index in the background within a 120 s budget, committing a partial index if it stops. It seeds a linked worktree from the main checkout, and stamps the findings baseline the first time the index is complete.
  - **Output:** none. A refresh failure is recorded in the index, and `orthogonality-checker.py` reports it once per session.
  - **Where the index lives:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/orthogonality/<project key>/`, a rebuildable cache removed with the plugin (a temp directory when that variable is unset; `SDH_ORTHOGONALITY_DIR` overrides). Nothing is written into the project.

**UserPromptSubmit** (before a prompt is processed):
- `vague-request-detector.py` — Command hook; never blocks.
  - **When it fires:** on an underspecified request. It adds context suggesting `sdh:requirements-consultant`, with a fallback when AskUserQuestion is unavailable.
  - **When it stays quiet:** on a prompt with a concrete signal: a path, backticks, a digit, an identifier, a stack name, or 12+ words.

**Stop** (each time Claude finishes responding):
- `session-stop-summary.py` — Command hook; never blocks. Shows you the working tree's state (staged, modified, untracked, ahead) as `systemMessage`, only when it changed since the last summary this session. It stays quiet when `stop_hook_active` is set. It does not validate task completion.

**SubagentStart** (when a subagent spawns):
- `subagent-context.py` — Command hook. Adds the house stack (the chart library per stack, drill-down navigation, and drill-down-ready APIs included) to every subagent's context as `additionalContext`. Team context is added only when the subagent is a member of this session's team (matched by the team config's `agentId`), and no file paths are injected.

**TeammateIdle** (when a teammate is about to go idle):
- `teammate-idle-checker.py` — Command hook; exit 2 with the reason on stderr keeps the teammate working.
  - **Fires when:** source changed in the teammate's own linked worktree with no matching test change.
  - **Skipped:** read-only agents (no edit tool in `agents/<role>.md` `tools:`) and vendored shadcn primitives. A shared checkout is never judged.
  - **Gives up:** after 3 identical rejections, telling you instead.

**TaskCreated** (when a task is created):
- `task-completed-checker.py` — Command hook; always exits 0. Snapshots the task's baseline, so the TaskCompleted gates judge only changes made after the task started, even outside a linked worktree.

**TaskCompleted** (when a task is marked complete). Both hooks are command hooks: exit 2 keeps the task open and feeds the stderr reason back. They fail open, so a crash exits 1, and they give up after 3 identical rejections.
- `task-completed-checker.py` — Rejects the completion in two cases:
  - a teammate's own worktree still has uncommitted changes;
  - a task that promises tests left no test-file change (commits count).
- `team-task-validator.py` — Rejects the completion over leftover debug statements (matched as statements: not in comments, strings, tests, or scripts), trailing whitespace, a missing final newline, or mixed indentation, in files the task touched. It stays quiet when a change cannot be attributed to the task.

## Agent Teams

Agent teams coordinate multiple Claude Code instances for parallel work. Use them for complex tasks that benefit from simultaneous exploration, cross-layer implementation, or multi-dimensional review.

### When to Use What

| Approach | Best For | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Single Session | Sequential tasks, simple features, bug fixes | "Fix the login timeout" |
| Subagents | Focused research, parallel reads, independent queries | "Search for all usages of UserService" |
| Agent Teams | Cross-layer features, parallel review, competing hypotheses | "Build user dashboard (API + web + mobile)" |

**Decision tree**: Use a team when the task involves 3+ layers, requires multi-dimensional review, or contains multiple independent deliverables that can be parallelized.

### Pre-defined Team Templates

Tell Claude to "use the [Template Name]" to spawn a coordinated team:

#### Feature Team (full-stack feature development)
- **Lead**: architecture-advisor (Opus, read-only) — designs, coordinates, reviews
- **Teammates**: rails-architect (backend), reactjs-dev, nextjs-developer (Next.js UI), or react-native-dev (frontend), test-generator (tests), security-auditor (security review)
- **When**: New feature spanning backend + frontend + tests

#### Review Team (comprehensive code review)
- **Lead**: code-reviewer — coordinates review dimensions
- **Teammates**: security-auditor (security lens), clean-architecture (architecture lens), test-generator (coverage lens)
- **When**: Large PRs, release reviews, audit preparation

#### Incident Team (production incident response)
- **Lead**: incident-responder (Opus) — triage, coordinate, post-mortem
- **Teammates**: devops-engineer (infrastructure), rails-architect (app layer), security-auditor (if breach suspected)
- **When**: Production outages, performance degradation, security incidents

#### Refactor Team (large-scale refactoring)
- **Lead**: architecture-advisor (Opus, read-only) — design target architecture
- **Teammates**: refactor-specialist (Opus, implementation), test-generator (safety net), code-reviewer (quality gate)
- **When**: Module extraction, pattern migration, dependency upgrades

#### Infrastructure Team (IaC and deployment)
- **Lead**: devops-engineer — infrastructure coordination
- **Teammates**: security-auditor (compliance), architecture-advisor (design review)
- **When**: Terraform module creation, CI/CD pipeline changes, cloud migrations

#### Design Team (design system and visual quality)
- **Lead**: design-system-architect (Opus, read-only) — token architecture, component specs
- **Teammates**: phlex-developer (Phlex components), nextjs-developer (Next.js UI from shadcn/ui), design-critique (visual quality review)
- **When**: Design system creation, cross-platform visual consistency, component library builds

### Dynamic Spawning

Claude will automatically suggest creating a team when:
1. The task involves 3+ layers (backend, frontend, tests, infrastructure)
2. The user asks to "review", "audit", or "investigate" across multiple dimensions
3. The task description includes multiple independent deliverables
4. The user explicitly asks for parallel work

### Team Coordination Conventions

- **File ownership**: Each teammate owns a distinct set of files — no two teammates edit the same file
- **Task sizing**: 5-6 tasks per teammate maximum for a single team session
- **Worktree isolation**: Use worktree isolation for teammates making parallel edits to avoid conflicts
- **Quality gates**: `TeammateIdle` and `TaskCompleted` hooks enforce deliverable quality automatically
- See the `std-agent-teams` skill for full coordination conventions

## Monorepo & Large Codebases

> Two distinct concerns, don't confuse them: **how the monorepo is engineered** (layout,
> boundaries, Turborepo, affected-only CI, one-version policy, per-app releases) is the
> `/monorepo-architect` skill + agent. **How Claude Code is configured for a large repo**
> (CLAUDE.md layering, excludes, worktrees) is this section and `docs/monorepo-setup.md`.

This plugin scales to monorepos and large single-tree codebases. It uses the
centralized model — `std-*` skills under `skills/` whose `paths:` scope them by
file path, with **wrapper-directory-agnostic** framework detection (your package
dirs can be named anything; detection uses canonical structure like `app/models`,
`src/pages`, `src/screens` plus marker files like `Gemfile`, `next.config.*`,
`vite.config.*`, `metro.config.js`). See `docs/monorepo-setup.md` for the full
setup:

- **Per-package `CLAUDE.md`** starter templates in `docs/templates/` (backend, mobile, web, next, python, shared) — copy into each package dir so its conventions layer on the root `CLAUDE.md`.
- **`.claude/settings.local.json.template`** — per-developer overrides: `claudeMdExcludes` (skip packages you don't touch), `additionalDirectories` (cross-package access), `worktree.sparsePaths` (scope worktree checkouts).
- **Build-artifact read denies** and **worktree symlinks** are pre-set in `.claude/settings.json` (`dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.*`, `vendor/`, Rails assets; `node_modules`/`vendor/bundle` symlinked into worktrees).
- **Code intelligence** — install language-server plugins (`typescript-lsp`, Ruby LSP) to cut file reads.
- The **SessionStart hook** reports which framework area you launched in and which rules apply.

## Enterprise Governance

- `managed-settings.template.json` — IT deployment template for non-overridable org policies
- `CLAUDE.local.md.template` — Developer personal override template (copy to CLAUDE.local.md)
- `.claude/settings.local.json.template` — Per-developer monorepo overrides (copy to `.claude/settings.local.json`)
